'''
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example:

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

To solve this, we will follow these steps âˆ’

Here we will use the dynamic programming approach, and solve this using recursion
Base case is, when n = 1, then return true
When n is already visited, return false
mark n as visited
n := n as string, l := list of all digits in n
temp := squared sum of all digits
return function recursively with parameter temp and visited list

class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        def get_next(n):
            total_sum = 0
            while n > 0:
                n, digit = divmod(n, 10)
                total_sum += digit ** 2
            return total_sum

        seen = set()
        while n != 1 and n not in seen:
            seen.add(n)
            n = get_next(n)

        return n == 1
