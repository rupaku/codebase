alexa simulator-> type intent and get response


The JSON input object was constructed from input data that the user entered through voice or text.
The Alexa simulator packaged up the input along with other relevant metadata and sent it to the backend service. You can see this in the JSON Input box.
The backend service received the input JSON object and parsed it to check the type of the request. Then, it passed the JSON to the relevant intent handler function.
The intent handler function processed the input and gathered the required response, which is sent back as a JSON response to the Alexa simulator. You can see this in the JSON Output box.
The Alexa simulator parsed this JSON and read the speech response back to you.
